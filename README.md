A Machine Learning model, which is trained using MS-COCO Dataset and uses YOLO Algorithm to detect objects in live video or a still image input.

YOLO This model uses the version 3 of the YOLO algorithm. I have not tried implementing the project with the latest version of the algorithm.

IMPORTANT There is a 'yolov3.weights' file which is an absolute necessary for the model to work. I was unable to upload it on here because it is 236MB. I will include a link to the file. Download the file from the link, and the other files from this repository and place them all in a single folder.
